        <h2>Your city, town or community where you live plays a big role in shaping a child’s growth.
            </h2>
            <p>UNICEF’s Child Friendly Cities Initiative has built a network of local governments and leaders
                that are securing the rights of children in their communities.
                </p>
<h3>The initiative listens to youth voices in order to improve child-friendly services, reduce child
    poverty, and promote safe environments and spaces for play.
    </h3>

     <h4>Since 1996, the Child Friendly Cities Initiative has formed a network of 3,000+ communities in
        40+ countries.
    </h4>

        <li>Gray - No CFCI
        </li>
        <li>Light Blue - Country with Child-Friendly Initiative
        </li>
        <li>Yellow - Past Child-Friendly Initiative</li>
        <li>Green - National Government Program Implemented
        </li>
    </ul>
<h4>In 2023, Houston, Texas, was certified as the first child-friendly city in the United States.
    <br>
    Cities can only become “child-friendly” if young people join in shaping local policies and
    programs that meet the needs of youth.
