    <p>You’ve seen some of the many things UNICEF does for children around the globe. But Maybe
        you’re still wondering… what, exactly, is UNICEF?</p>

                    UNICEF is part of the United Nations… and it’s all for kids.
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    UNICEF stands for the United Nations Children’s Fund, and it works in 190 countries and
                    territories (pretty much everywhere in the world!) to keep children healthy, educated, protected
                    and respected.

                <h3>
                    UNICEF is funded by entirely voluntary contributions.
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    UNICEF is funded by you and me.
                    <br>
                    While UNICEF is part of the United Nations, it’s funded by entirely voluntary contributions.
                    <br>
                    That means that countries aren’t required to support UNICEF financially-rather, they choose to
                    do so every year because they want to be part of building an enormous support system for kids.
                    UNICEF also receives funds from business, foundations, and people just like you, who want to
                    help vulnerable children</p>
            </div>

                <h3>
                    UNICEF works both in emergencies and on development goals.
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    UNICEF got its start during an emergency-helping hungry children after World War II-and it still
                    rushes aid to children and their families in emergencies, such as wars or natural disasters.
                    <br>
                    But at the same time, UNICEF works toward big, long-term goals. That means things like
                    eliminating entire diseases, or making sure everyone has access to safe water by 2030.</p>

                <h3>
                    UNICEF works for every child-and their rights.
                </h3>
                    <p>
                    UNICEF doesn’t discriminate when it comes to helping kids or saving their lives; it sees all
                    children as equally worthy of help, no matter where they live, what their government is doing, or
                    what religion they follow.
                    <br>
                    That’s why UNICEF so often says it works for every child, and fights for their right to grow up
                    healthy and happy. What will you do to help others?
