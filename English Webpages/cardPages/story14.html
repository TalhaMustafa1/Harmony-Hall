        <h2>Girls can make communities and even whole countries succeed, but with gender inequality too
            often gets in the way of them reaching their full potential.

            <p>Removing those barriers will lift everyone, for generations to come.

                <p>UNICEF helps teen girls stay in school and finish secondary education, helping their transition
                    to the workforce. Skill-development opportunities are also available through youth centers and
                    other child-friendly spaces.

            Over time, Osama regained hope for his future, adjusted to life with his disability, and became a
            competitive chess player. He recently returned to school, and dreams of becoming an architect.
