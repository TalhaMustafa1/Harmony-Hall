        <p>UNICEF wants every student to benefit from having the internet in their schools.
            </p>
            <p>A joint initiative between UNICEF and the International Telecommunications Union, Giga’s
                mission is to connect every school in the world.
                </p>
<p>
    How does Giga connect schools to the internet?
</p>

<p>
    Step one: Find out which schools are and aren’t connected.
</p>

<p>
    Internet Connectivity at Schools in Brazil
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data unavailable
        </li>
        <li>Moderate</li>
        <li> No connectivity</li>
        <li>Good
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Total Schools: 138,755</li>
        <li>Connected Schools: 108,362</li>
        <li>Avg. Internet Speed (Download): 63.6 Mb/s</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The average internet speed is good enough for e-learning.
Schools with no internet: 21.01%
</p>

<p>
    Step two: Connect schools to the Internet.
</p>
<p>Giga works with governments, internet service providers, and other businesses to help schools
    get Internet access through negotiating fair prices and investing in networks</p>
